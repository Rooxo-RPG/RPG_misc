##The Bunker

When the Raiders first started taking control of the nearby villages, they had the Settlers build them a fortress, from where they could easily control the villages. This fortress became known as the Bunker. From here the Raiders send out patrols to the villages every day, where they check if all settlers are still where they are supposed to be and collect any goods they find in the villages. In case settlers are missing, they first search for them near the villages and if they can't find them there they go back to the Bunker and send other Raiders to find them. Both the patrols and search missions use horses to get around. It takes them about half an hour to reach the farthest village, the Northern Village. There are about 60 Raiders living in the Bunker, about half of which regularly visit the villages.

##The Northern Village

The Northern Village is the village furthest from the Bunker, and the smallest one with only 6 Settlers living in it. Their main way of surviving is fishing in the lake next to the village, but the Settlers had to start farming grapes, when the Raiders weren't satisfied with how much fish they produced. 

##The Southern Village

The southern Village is bigger than the Northern one, but not as big as the Eastern Village with 14 Settlers living there. The people from the southern Village specialize in farming grain and domesticated animals. 

##The Eastern Village

This is the biggest of the three villages with a population of 23 Settlers. These settlers also fish in the lake, but they also produce a lot of fruit and some grain.
