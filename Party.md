# The Party


The party consists of 5 people, the half-human, half-dragonborn wizard Faye
Grimmsy, the dwarfen fighter Gramthrun Hammerforge and his best friend the
cleric Sylvarus Aldion and the tiefling sisters Eaki the rogue and Yatari the
warlock.

## Faye Grimmsy

Faye, the leader of the party, is half-human and half-dragonborn and was raised
by human family named Grimmsy. She doesn’t know her real origins, but she is
searching for answers. When she turned 18, she started wizard training under a
powerful wizard by the name of Elrune. After two years of training her teacher
sent her out to see the world and study on her own. On her travels, she met the
sisters Eaki and Yatari, who joined her on her travels in hope for a saved life.
Later she met Gramthrun and Sylvarus, who also joined them, because they
simply liked them and liked adventures.


## Gramthrun Hammerforge and Sylvarus Aldion
The dwarf Gramthrun Hammerforge grew up in the city of Orvon, where Syl-
varus, an elf that lived in the Fey also spent a lot of time. There they became
best friends as children and later started traveling together looking for adven-
tures. Sylvarus is a Cleric of the god Pelor, the God of the Sun and Gramthrun
a bulky figher. He isn’t the brightest tough, so he relies on Sylvarus for im-
portant decisions. And although he looks like a mindless brute, he means well
and is a very gentle soul. Sylvarus is pretty smart, he leads Gramthrun and
looks out for him, so he doesn’t get into situations he can’t handle. They joined
Faye’s party, because Faye looked for help in recovering an magical artifact and
then stayed in the party, because they liked them and felt like the party needed
them(and they needed the party)

## Eaki and Yatari
The tiefling sisters Eaki and Yatari grew up as orphans in the poor parts of
the city Blackwater. They were all alone, so they had to survive any way they
could. Eaki, the younger sister learned skills like pickocketing and lockpicking
to secure any food for them and Yatari studied from ancient tomes and became
a warlock protecting them both. When Faye met them in the city, they didn’t
trust her at first, but Faye earned their trust and took them with her out of the
slums of the city. They still have issues with trusting people, even Gramthrun
and Sylvarus, but Faye is now like a mother to them.
