When a PC dies, they are no longer able to freely do whatever they want
they are now ghosts, boud to the demon and have only limited powers

Each ghost gets all of the actions at first, and gets all of them again once all have been used

good actions:
	1. give players help on any psychic/mental based roll (+1 on roll),
		this happens through information they give the players
		(for example, a player that has to resist the demon's control and the ghost gives them a clue how to resist it)
	2. stop the demons current action
		(for example stop a current possesion, GM decides, when stopping is allowed, when not and how much can be done
		(for example player that would die lives, just gets injured instead))

bad actions:
	1. give demon information about players (demon reads ghosts mind)
		gives players -1 on rolls for the next mind/psychic based roll
	2. possess a something, that brings players in danger(ghost gets controlled by demon)

neutral:
	1. give players a hint x2
		can be an actual hint or wrong information provided by the demon
		don't tell players which one it is, 50/50 chance (secret roll, change probabilities as needed)
