# The Sory on the Wall
This story is the story of the demon stuck in the cabin, written as rules on the wall

The Nameless One once ruled over the entire world, heaven and hell. He was all powerful, not even God himself could stop him.
But then his followers turned against him, their minds corrupted by envious lesser demons.
When all turned against him, he was prisoned into the deepest depths of hell.
But he knew he would come back. So he bound himself to the very book that could banish him.
When he returns it will be through this book and he will once again reign over the world, now stronger than ever
