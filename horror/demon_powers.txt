The powers the demon can use at any point in order to bring the players to summon it into the world
the demon's powers can only be used in its power radius which is the cabin +about 25m 

1. take control of a player
	player can try to resist the demon by rolling against a DC of 12
	(change the DC as appropriate)
	when a player fails to resist, they can try again after 1d12 minutes

2. haunt an object
	the demon takes control of an object, making it move by itself
	it can make the object fly through the room
	when it throws it the object flies 1d% out of its power radius
	any object can be moved, if it can move freely(can't rip out door for example, only open and close it)

3. force people/animals to the cabin
	each person/animal that has been to the cabin and has heard/felt the presence of the demon can be forced to return to the cabin
	the demon might choose to force someone back or it might let them go
	when it does, the person/animal feels a strong desire to return to the cabin
	if they ignore it, they get a very strong headache that leads to unconsciousness when ignored/counteracted
	
4. control an animal/NPC
	the demon can control any animal or NPC
	an NPC might resist and gain control back, an animal can't
	when the demon lets go of an animal it immediately dies

5. talk psychically
	when the demon talks psychically the person hears the voice inside his head
	only who the demon wants to hear its message hears it 
	it can also make someone see pictures in their head/induce hallucinations/nightmares
	when the demon talks to the players it will try to make them turn on each other and use that as an advantage
	he will say things like:
		"he will sacrafice you, stop him"
		"how did you find this cabin? some of them have to have known about it"


Note: the demon cannot use it's powers to force himself(for example use an animal to do it)
its power on the world is too weak
