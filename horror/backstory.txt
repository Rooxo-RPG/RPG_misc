The backstory what happened before the players came

the cabin is located deep in the woods, and contains one living room with a small kitchen
and a bedroom. Upsairs, hidden from sight there is a study and under the cabin, also hidden
there is a hidden room where the demonic ritual took place.
the cabin was once home to a crazy person, who tried to summon a powerful demon, simply known as the Nameless One
after reading in a book that promised him the fulfillment of all of his wishes by the demon.
When he then did the summoning through a ritual involving the sacrifice of a person,
he realized the mistake he made unleashing this demon on the world.
He then tried to banish the demon again, performing the banishing ritual, but dying in the process.
But this wasn't enough to undo his mistake as he died before finishing it. 
Instead he only bound it to his cabin limiting its power on the world.
Using its limited power on the world, the demon then lured whoever it could into the cabin
and tried to make them summon him completely into the world.
They all went insane from its influence and eventually killed themselves or got killed by the demon after it realized they wouldn't summon it
after returning to the cabin several times
