# Clues

These are all the clues the players can find in the cabin

1. Near the house they find another corpse  
	the guy probably ran away from the cabin and the demon killed it  
	When they investigate it, they find a piece of a puzzle	(the puzzle to open the sacrifice chamber)  

2. When the players come to the cabin, they find a woman hanging from a tree outside  
	If they investigate her they find a suicide note. It reads:  
	"i can't take it anymore. These voices always drag me back here, wanting me to do horrible things. There is no escape. Maybe in death i will finally be at rest"  

3. Inside the cabin there is a suspicious dent in the wall  
	after further investigation it turns out the dent is a keyhole  

4. The key to the keyhole in the wall is hidden in the cabin in some pots  
	as a hint a ghost might rattle the pots  

5. If they use the key to open the safe in the wall, the notebook is inside  
	The notebook needs to be deciphered  
	If the players don't figure out, the notebook is caesar deciphered, they might see it in a nightmare or get told by the demon (not explicitely though)  

6. Outside there is a pile of rubbel with forms that seem to stem from a hole in the wall, but a piece is missing(see clue 1.)  
	When they figured the puzzle out(tangram) the wall moves to reveal a door down to beneath the cabin  
	Down there is the sacrifice chamber	  

7. In the sacrifice chamber there are runes on the wall  
	if anyone can read the runes they reveal the story of the Nameless One  
	when read the readers voice will change, as if speaking in tongues  

8. In the sacrifice chamber there is an old tome    
	the tome tells about how to summon and how to banish the demon  
	the demon will want to stop them from finding out how to banish him  

9. two bodies are in the sacrifice chamber  
	one is a slit open person hung from the ceiling, the sacrifice  
	the other one is the acolyte, in his hands a bloody improvised cross, made from a knife rammed trough a stick
