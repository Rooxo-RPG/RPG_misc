#RPGs and worldbuilding

Everything I made for tabletop games and worlds I built

##Content 

* SADBOYS: a DnD 4e campaign about a group of bandits called the S A D B O Y S
* The Party: a random fantasy party for a oneshot that never happened
* SAO: one floor(based on floor 35 in the anime) of SAO in GURPS lite
* bioshock: detective mistery in rapture from bioshock
* post-apocalypse: a post-apocalyptic setting(no plot)

##Sources

for the post-apocalypse map I used [these](http://captscott.deviantart.com/art/Fantasy-Brush-Pack-01-191047320) brushes.

I'm most likely going to use [this](http://starraven.deviantart.com/art/Sketchy-Cartography-Brushes-198264358) brush pack as well.
