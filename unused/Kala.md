# Kala

##Physique

Full-grown Kala reach a height of up to five meters while weighting around 500 kg. 
Their bodies have roughly the shape of humans, but their whole body is covered in stones.
Kala don't have any heads, their torsos just end flat, with two holes in the stones where their eyes lay, which are almost perfectly round and black.
Their face is a smaller hole between the eyes and a bit lower.
They only have two fingers on each hand and no feet to speak of.
Under the stones that cover their body they don't have any skin, leaving bare skin if stones are removed. 
This is why the stones are deep inside their flesh, inserted as soon as they reach full height after 5 years they take to mature.
During that time Kala are very sensitive and have to be protected by older ones so they don't die.
Once they have reached maturity they don't die for hundreds of years, some almost living for a thousand years.
The bodies of Kala survive with very little food, only needing the few plants they can find in the high mountains where they live.

* live in the mountain range in the center 
* have bodies surrounded by rock
* need very little sustinance but are also slow as a result
* eat rocks to buld up their shell, but can't survive on that alone
* for survival they eat what little vegetation they find in the mountains
* herbivores
* seldomly need water
* when they do they migrate to a water source, and fill up their bodies for multiple days
* after that they can survive for half a year without refilling
* different versions on both mountain raiges
