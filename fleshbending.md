# Fleshbending

Fleshbending is the art of using the power stored within a living body to alter one's own.
In order to extract the power of a body to use it, one has to burn it.
It can be done using human bodies as well as animal bodies, but human bodies are many times more powerfull than animal ones and the strongest human bodies are the ones of strong fleshbenders.
The kind of animal is also important in to process, the bigger the animal the more powerfull the extracted power will be.
Regardles of what kind of body is used, the longer the body has been dead, the weaker the power that can be extracted from it, so the strongest power comes from bodies that are still alive when burned.
When the body is burned one can either wait until it has burned up, leaving only a single red bead the size of a fist behind. 
When this bead is eaten, the person gets access to the power stored within.
Alternatively, the powers can already be absorbed by another person while the body is still burning.
For that the person has to enter the flames while the body burns and has to wait until the body burned out.
The second method is even stronger than the first one, but it is also many times more painful.
That is not to say eating the bead is not painful, in fact it feels like the flames are burning inside the person eating it.
When the powers are released inside a body, the person gains the power to alter their own physique.
Very small amounts of the power can, for example, be used to improve someone's vision or hearing, while bigger amounts can strengthen muscles.
Only if the power is taken direcly inside flames from a burning human body, that is still alive, it is possible to create more body mass.
In all other cases mass can only be moved around in the body.
For example improving leg muscles might require to take muscles from arms or other places in the body.
But even when new mass can be created even the best benders can't create more mass than 1% of the burned body's mass.
