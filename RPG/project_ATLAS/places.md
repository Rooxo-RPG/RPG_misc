## Lord Defender's town

The town north of the lake is the biggest of the three local towns.
People here are ruled by a superhuman they refer to as the Lord Defender. 
He has strong healing powers that attract many people to his town. 
In addition to that he is known as a very wise and thoughtful leader, the people happily follow.
As a result this town is not only the biggest one, but also the one where people are are happiest and healthiest. 
The hunters here have the best weapons and training to hunt in the norhtern woods and there rarely are any cases of hunters getting killed in the forsest.
Unfortunately the stability and big population of the town often attracts other superhumans that try to kill the Lord defender and take his town. 
To defend the city the Lord Defender employs a handful of superhumans that help him defend the city.

## Gamma's village

The village south of the lake used to be controlled by a superhuman named Gamma, who apparently could manipulate electromagnetic radiation, that allowed him to create superhumans and even heal mutations. 
Unfortunately he suddenly vanished about a  month ago, telling no one where he went.
Some believe he died, but his body was never found.
Regarless of where he went, the village fell into chaos. 
Many superhumans who had heard of a village not under any control gathered in the village hoping to replace Gamma. 
Of course none of them wanted to give power to someone else, so a fight started between them. 
After that the people all ran away, many finding refugee in the northern NAME village, others trying to survive on their own.
The superhumans fighting here now have already destroyed most of what was left of the village, so the winner would rule over a destroyed and empty village.
But the fight is still going on between 4 superhumans who couldn't just walk away from a pointless fight.
The first one calls himself the Ox, because his body is many times bigger than that of a normal human, as well as his strength. 
He can easily rip apart a human's body and destroy walls by punching them.
The second one calls herself the Silver Flash, because her power is super speed, and her weapon of choice is a Scimitar, leaving her victims to only see a flash of silver as they get sliced to pieces. 
The third one calls himself Viper, from his superpower to create poison and inject it into his victims.
He uses a wide array of different weapons, all spiked with his body's own poison, that can kill in few seconds after being injected.
His superpower also makes him immune from most poisons, but since his powers can't protect him from being killed, his strategy is one of setting traps and not being caught in a head-on fight.
The last one of the superhuman fighting in Gamma village calls herself the Illusionist. 
She can create illusions of herself to distract her opponents and can even use them to attack.
This makes it hard for any opponent to even come close to her, as they can't know who is the real one until they attack, but often leave themselves open to attacks from a different illusion in the process.

## Doom's town

The Doom town is the most eastern village, controlled by a superhuman called Doom, who named himself after the Marvel comics villain.
Doom has the ability to shoot thunder from his fingers and believes himself to be above normal humans because of his powers.
He believes them to be a blessing by the universe that has chosen him to rule over the ones beneath him.
This philosophy is also how he rules over his village, killing anyone that opposes him in the slightest and forcing the others to obey him with threats of violence.
The town itself used to be a suburban city, but most of it has been destroyed by ATLAS attacks and later Doom's temperament.
Doom himself lives in an old industrial building, where he experiments with his powers on old electrical equipment, so far with little success, as he tends to destroy anything he uses his powers on.
The people are held there by Dooms personal army, that partol the town and hunt down anyone that tries to escape without permission.
One of them has the power of very strong senses, he uses to track down people and the other one has extremely strong legs, allowing her to jump on top of buildings, making it very easy to hunt people down.
The ones that are caught aren't normally killed, as Doom depends on the people to hunt and bring water for him.
Instead they are tortured by Doom personally, but in a way leaving them able to continue working.
The town gathers food and water by hunting in the eastern woods and bringing water from the nerby lake.
Hunting is very dangerous, as the animals are also left mutated from the nuclear fallout.
Many are more dangerous and aggressive than before, leaving many of the hunters, who were never trained, to die.
