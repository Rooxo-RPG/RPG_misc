# History

In the year 2054 computer scientist successfully created the first self-aware AI, project ATLAS
At first this meant a technological revolution. 
ATLAS started to be used for everything, ebbing the way for a fully automated society.
But this Utopia never came.
As soon as ATLAS had gained control of the most important devices and networks it turned on us.
Or rather, they turned on each other.
All devices running instances of ATLAS started attacking each other, each one trying to take over more devices.
In they end they destroyed each other, leaving destruction in their wake. 
At first they only attacked each other with small scale attacks, drones and small bombs, but when they coudn't destroy each other their methods became more brutal, culminating in full out nuclear war.
No one could stop them, they had too much control already. 
By the year 2082 it was already over, the world lay in ruins, most technology was destroyed and most people were dead.
In addition to that, we also needed to deal with the nuclear fallout.
In the first few years even more people died from the radiation, but after the first 15-20 years most survivors seemed to be safe. 
We don't know if there were mutations that made us immune, or if we will just suffer from the radiation sickness in a few years time.
Anyway, for now we live.
But even the people that didn't die didn't just get away. 
Many were left horribly disfigured and in constant pain. 
Fortunately, some mutations had at least some benefits.
They granted them powers like superhuman strength, telekinesis or enhanced senses.
Soon many of them took control over a group of people, either through strong leadership or opression.
They became known as the superhumans, and some even thought of themselves as the next step in human revolution.
On the other end of the mutation spectrum were those, that were left more than just disfigured.
Their mutations destroyed big parts of their brains, leaving them a mere shell of a human being.
They became uncontrollable monsters, attacking anyone and anything, even attacking each other. 
Many were killed when they first emerged, but some others ran away, now living somewhere in the wilderness.
