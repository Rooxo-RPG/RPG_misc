the party sarted at floor 35, looking for quests, they found 2
both were prety simple, killing a few mobs
first they go into a bar where the blind player hits on the ugliest woman in the bar and can barely leave without her
Then they start the first quest, killing bunnies, where one player even gets badly injured
unfortunately another players bloodlust was so bad, he immedietly ate one of the bunnies making them miss one piece of meat for the quest
they manage to pull one rabbit from a group and slay it, but only after losing a weapon, which isn't a big deal because MMO
when they return to the city the rabbit slayer's bad luck comes into play and they get lost and only find a way into the city that leads over a bridge
unfortunately the rabbit slayer also is very afraid of bridges and he can't cross it
they decide on trying to throw him over the river and catching him on the other side
after the blind one throws him over, one of the other players falls into the river, but the other one "catches" him getting badly injured
the one in the water can barely hold himself over water, but the rabbit slayer throws him his shirt with which he can climb out of the river
they then go back into the city, deliver the quest and end the day in the bar
the blind player follows two drug dealers and sleeps in the lobby of the hotel they live in
while the one that got barely killed by the rabbits goes to buy some potions the other two players spend their time humiliating the third one
in the evening the humiliated and the shopper decide to take a room, while the weapon loser sleeps on the town fountain
the rabbit slayer is last in the bar and when he exits he realises how drunk he is
he then finds his friend sleeping on the fountain and wakes him up, resulting in him landing on a bench and being unable to stand up 
on the next they they somehow manage to find each other near the fountain, and leave to finish the next quest
on the way there they find the levels maze and the curious ones can't keep themselves from checking it out.
they enter and get attacked by the monkeys inside
they flee but try to enter again, this time with a new strategy
after a long hard battle where one player almost dies, they manage to defeat the first monsters of the dungeon
