The high priest told me today might be my day. I'm so excited, after I've served Suhu for the last 10 years, today might be the day she will talk to me and give me access to her powers. What's this weird feeling in my body? I feel powerful. Is this it, is Suhu going to talk to me? I think I can hear something.  

"Hello there young discipe"  
Holy shit it's her.  
"Yes, it's me, Suhu"  
You can hear my thoughts?  
"Of course I can. We are now connected."  
So I have now access to powers?  
"To some of them, yes. The connection is still weak, I need you to prove yourself, before I give you more. But first, I must teach you to use your new powers."  
Yes, my godess  
"Now, do you see that puddle in front of you? Touch it and feel its temperature"  
Yes, my godess.  
"Good. Now concentrate on that feeling on your hand... And now change it. Just think of cooler water on your hand. Can you feel it cooling down?"  
My hand does feel more chilly now  
"Very good, continue that until it freezes"  
Come on, freeze...  
I think I see some ice forming...  
"Good, go on"  
There it is, the puddle is now frozen... and my hand is stuck   
"Well done, Next I want you to reverse the thing. Unfreeze your hand"  
I feel my hand warming up...  
The ice is softening...  
Ok I did it, my hand is free again  
"You are very talented. Not many are this fast their first time. You might go a long way if you keep trainging"  
Thanks, my godess  
"For now your powers are limited to cooling things to the freezing point of water and heating them up to the temperature of a warm summer's day. Find yourself a mentor that will train you and teach you what you need to know."   
I will, my godess  
"But before I can send you off to train your powers, I need you to prove  yourself."  
Anything for my godess  
"Go back to your high priest, I gave him the details of your mission. You will be going to the isle of gods. If you doo good on this mission I might strengthen our bond"    
Yes, my godess.  

Oh, the voice is gone. Looks like Suhu has stopped paying attention to me. Going to the isle of gods... I wonder what I'm supposed to do here... Let's see what the high priest can tell me.  

"Murid, I have expected you. I'm assuming Suhu has told you about your mission?"  
"I only know I'm going to the isle of gods"  
"Yes you are. And you will bring our guards a message directly from Suhu herself. I have prepared a horse, which will take you to the coast. There you will need to find someone to take you to the island. Do not open the message, it is not meant for your eyes. Here is the message and enough money to bring you over the ocean and back. Good luck, young disciple."  
"I will give my best to not disappoint my godess"
