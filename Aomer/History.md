# History

## Early Societies

After the first sentient races developed, they created the first societies.
Those are collectively known as the early societies.
The Ucilan developed good sailing technology and managed to colonize all of the worlds deserts very quickly, but since the rest of the world is too cold for them to survive they can't advance any further.
The Ika slowly expand through all of the Obol Archipelago, and their cousins, Iko, expanded on the Islands and around the Archipelago.
The Fano expanded all over Iim, except for mountainous and swampy regions, where the Gero and Gando lived.
Gando also expanded to the mountain Ix, where their leader lived and the Xar peaks, where they had a lot more free space.
They didn't expand to the Wrasok Highlands, Alst Mountains and Tark Peaks, as the former two were inhabited by the Kala and the latter by the Manuk.
At first, the Kala only lived in the Alst mountains, but later expanded into the Wrasok Highlands, as they survived very long and needed more space to live.
Apart from living in the Nomn Marsh, some Gero populated the Ysk Wetlands and Ipahr Swamp. 
The Gero living there lost contact with the other two places soon, making three distinct societies emerge over time.
In the Drubo forest, the Drubo and Orein started living in a dual society together, as Orein could communicate with the Drubo.
The last society that formed was the Raul society, a very violent one, that quickly overran the whole planet, starting from the Blahl woods.
Soon after the early societies had formed, the Gods whispered to the first people that would become mages. 
These early mages all went to live in the Citadel island, to serve their god and learn about its magic. 
Quickly Citadel island was inhabited by four parallel societies, each composed of followers of a different god. 
They all tried killing and sabotaging each other in the hope of being able to free their own god, while stopping the others.

## The Raul empire

After 3000 years, when all societies had formed, the Raul had expanded over most of the plains and forests of Kliss.
When they didn't have any more room to expand they attacked the Drubo forest, conquering the Orein people and conquering the Gero on Kliss.
Once they had secured the forest, they attacked the Wrasok Highlands, hoping to defeat the Kala people.
The warriors of the Kala people crushed them, however, as the sharp teeth and claws of the Raul don't have much use against their stone bodies. 
After their crushing defeat in the mountains, the Raul attacked the Ucilan instead and conquered all of the deserts, slaughtering most that stood in their way and enslaving the rest.
After that they conquered the Iko in the Obol Archipelago.
Some of them could escape into the sea to the Ika, but most weren't as lucky.
This prompted the Manuk to willingly surrender themselves and joining the Raul empire to avoid getting slaugthered.
With the flying Manuk and the sailing expertise of the Ucilan the Raul could now easily attack the other islands and conquer the rest of the Gero people and the Fano, living on Iim, and kill all the refugees on Zast.
At last they attacked the Gando, but were defeated again, leaving the final size of the empire as all of Aomer except the mountains.
Over the years the Raul often tried attacking them again, but never managed to take them over.
Because the Raul weren't explorers and had no magic users they didn't know about the Citadel island for a very long time leaving the mages on their own fighting to bring about the end of the world.
When they finally found out about it, signalled the end of their empire.

## The fall of the empire

Once the Raul found out about Citadel island, almost 1000 years after they had conquered the rest of the world, they went to expand their empire even further.
Since they heard rumors of powerful warriors living there, they sent most of their forces toward it to make sure they could conquer it.
Unfortunately the strongest warriors of the Raul were no match for the powerful mages on Citadel island who banded together to defeat the invaders. 
This was the worst defeat the Raul had ever faced, diminishing their army and leaving them weak.
The Orein, seeing their opportunity, made an alliance with the Kala people, who until now refused to help them for fear of being defeated when fighting outside the mountains.
After the Kala joined the revolution, almost all other races(except the Gabu) joined as well, and they could overthow the empire, albeit with huge losses.
Most of the Raul population was slaughtered in the attacks and the rest were forced into Flok grove, which then was surrounded by walls and stationed soldiers from the races defeating them.
After this fall, most races returned to their homelands and rebuilt their societies that were oppressed by the Raul.
The places, where the Raul lived before the start of their empire became neutral places, containing mixed towns and villages. 

## Rise of the religions

Once the Raul were defeated the religions became more powerful over the years.
More mages came to be and some returned from the citadel after their training, building religious institutions, where they taught more mages and increased the influence of the religion.
This lead to even more mages being born which, in turn gave the religions even more power.
Soon the religions were powerful enough, that the planet got seperated into four different countries, each worshipping a different god.
The Kala, overwhelmingly worshipping Omoi controlled the Wrasok Highlands, the Alst mountains and the neighboring regions as the first country.
The second country spanned Zast, the Tozik Desert and the island Nih, being inhabited by mostly Ucilan and worshipping Suhu.
The northern part of Kliss, from the Drubo forest northward made up the third country, whorshipping Aine, and containing the most different races.
The last country was only the island Iim, whorshipping Zaas.
Since the gods themselves stood at odds, the countries followed suit.
The country of Zaas closed it's borders and didn't let worshippers of different gods into the country, only takign in religious refugees.
Same goes for the island of Zaast and Nih.
On the mainland borders, which went along the border of the Tozik Desert and the border between Drubo forest and the Wrasok Highlands, extended by Cerst River on the one side and the Ysk wetlands on the other, walls and watch towers were built in some places.
In other places soldiers were stationed, making sure no one can move from one country to the other.
While this was a recipe for war, for the longest time no one thought they had the upper hand, so no official attacks were started by anyone.
This only changed after the Raul uprising.

## The Raul uprising

When the four countries started fortifing their borders and distrusting each other, they still left Flok Grove a neutral zone, because they all realized the danger posed by the captured Raul.
Over the next 500 years the people started underestimating the Raul and slowly decreased their security measures one after another.
Because of that the Raul managed to defeat the stationed soldiers and break free of their prison. 
Once they had managed that it didn't take them long to conquer all of Zast and threatening to move to the mainland of Kliss.
Because they knew the strength of the Raul messengers were sent to citadel island and an army of the most powerful mages came to defeat them.
Defeating the Raul this time was a lot harder than the first time, as they knew the powers of the mages this time.
The mages were still victorious after a long battle that cost many of their lives and not only eradicated every last Raul, but also left the whole island of Zast in ashes.
Parts of the island were so hot that anytihng entering it would start to burn up immediately, while other parts were cold enough to freeze anything that enters.
Even other parts had gravitational anomalities, temporal ones and even transmutational ones, changing materials at random.
This made Zast uninhabitable for a very long time, possible never to recover.
Such a horrible event left the political system unstable, leading to the war that people had expected for hundreds of years.

## The War of the Gods

After the Raul had been defeated everone, especially the country of Suhu, which had lost the most, looked for someone to blame for the uprising and the following destruction of Zast. 
This very quickly lead to attacks between the countries, sabotages of border controls, and eventually to a full on war between the four countries.
It was clear that whoever won the war would now be able to release their own god, meaning every country would fight until the very end.
At first the forces were almost balanced.
Although the country of Suhu was the weakest, they had the advantage of a relatively small border through which only one the country of Omoicould attack, which had to fight in the north against the country of Aine.
Stil, Suhu soon found themselves in a dangerous position, fearing to be defeated.
Because of that, they soon sent for help from the Citadel mages.
Because they knew they couldn't let their country lose the fight the green mages, Suhu's mages, sent their strongest ones to join the fight.
The other countries quickly followed their lead and soon all mages from Citadel island had joined the war.
Once all mages had joined the fight the powers were evenly matched again, and no end was in sight.
But this was what all of the gods had planned for, independently from another, not knowing about the other gods plans.
Each one selected a small group of mages to perform the ritual in secret while the war was still going on.
Now four small groups of mages head toward citadel island to free their god, not knowing about the other ones.
Once the first group arrived, they immediately started the ritual. 
Before they were finished a different group arrived and stopped them, starting a fight to decide who gets to perform it in the end.
The other 2 groups joined the fight very soon and they fought to their deaths over their gods.
Once only one group remained they started doing the ritual, while the rest of the world still fought about it, not knowing it had already been decided on the other side of the world.
After the ritual had finished, the seal holding the god had been broken, destroying the world and the other gods within and freeing it.
None of the mages knew what they were doing until the moment the world ended.
