# Aomer

Aomer is a spherical planet and has a circumference of about 600km. It has a sun and a moon, with a day/night cycle of around 20 hours. A year on this Aomer is about 500 days long, spanning over 4 seasons which are all around 125 days long. A moon cycle takes 15 days, leaving the world with over 30 different months in a year. Aomer is also filled with magical energy which comes from supernatural beings that are bound to the planet by their peers, who banished them from their world. These are considered gods by the people of Aomer. They all want to escape the planet, but releasing one of them would destroy the planet and kill the other ones in the process. So these beings manipulate the people of Aomer in order to be the one to escape from the planet. They lend their power to those that help them escape and start wars trying to erase the followers of the other ones.
