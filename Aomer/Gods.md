#Gods

The Gods of Aomer are supernatural beings, imprisoned inside the planet by their peers. There are four of them, each one fighting against the others to gain enough followers, who can help them escape from the planet. What the followers don't know though, is that not only will they free their god, by performing the ritual their god wants them to perform, they will also destroy the other gods along with the planet they are living on. For their loyalty the gods grant their followers magical powers, taught to them by special Chosen Ones the gods personally talk to.
