#Gods

The Gods of Aomer are supernatural beings, imprisoned inside the planet by their peers. All four of them have powers that influence the planet to an extent where life could start and stay on Aomer. Though working together to bring life to the planet, each one is fighting against the others to gain enough followers, who can help them escape from the planet. What the followers don't know though, is that not only will they free their god, by performing the ritual their god wants them to perform, they will also destroy the other gods along with the planet they are living on. In return for their obediance the gods may choose to give some of their followers parts of their power. These chosen ones are also the ones that have to perform the final ritual that will kill them all. Once a god has given away some of it's power, it can't be taken back. So any disobediant followers keep their powers, but face other punishments by their former god, with which they will have to live with the rest of their life. Each god can only punish those that have opened themselves up to them and agreed to take their power and if someone changes loyalty, they won't lose their curses.

##Omoi

Omoi, the god of gravity, does not care for his followers any more than he needs to get them to help him out. He will only seldomly give out powers to anybody and has very little regard for any life on Aomer. He will command wars and genocides and will crush those that disobey him, as every living being is just a tool to escape this world and worth nothing if it doesn't contribute to his goals. As a result of all this, Omoi has the least followers of the four gods. But those that are drawn to him are very violent and push the hardest to perform the freeing ritual. So very often the other gods' followers will band together to stop Omoi from being freed, although even after all Omoi's followers have been killed, he always finds new people that serve him. He can grant his followers the power to move matter and exert pressure on it. Depending on how loyal Omoi decides someone was, he can give them varying strengths of the power or increase it when someone has proven themselves. The strongest known mages of that power could crush rocks as big as 20 m^3 and throw those as far as 6 meters.
