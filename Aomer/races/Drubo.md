# Drubo

## Physique
Drubo look like ordinary tree from the outside, but use their roots in much the same way other species use their brain.
They connect to other Drubo using them and can communicate that way.
They can also move most of their branches and, depending on the width, even more their trunks.
Since they don't have any faces, they can neither talk nor hear, but can sene vibrations in the ground they use to communicate with other species.
Drubo reproduce asexual, by dropping seeds, similar to the way normal trees reproduce.
A Drubo grows over 20-40 years after half of which they gain their consciousness.
They will then live for hundreds of years if not killed by a fireor something similar before.

* live in the big forest south of the fish people
* cannot move from where they grew, only some branches, act as arms
* communicate through a network of roots
