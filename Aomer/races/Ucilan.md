# Ucilan

## Physique 

The body of a Ucilan looks like the body of a snake, but around the middle it splits into three, giving them three tails. 
Those tails can either be used as hands, or can be rolled up to allow them to move like snakes. 
The body is up to two meters long, and the split can be almost immediately behind the head or almost in the end, giving a Ucilan either longer or shorter tails. 
But most are around the middle of the body. 
Their head has a rounded triangle shape, eyes sticking out on the sides, and mouth going from side to side. 
Noses are just two small holes in the front. 
The head is directly on the body, which is scaled with most colors  being possible.
Ucilan are born from eggs that are buried underground and grow up over the course of only 2 weeks, after which they live for another 2 years, before they die.
