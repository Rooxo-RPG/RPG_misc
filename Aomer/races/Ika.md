# Ika

## Physique

The Ika are a fishlike people, that can only survive underwater, unlike the related species Iko.
They have long oval bodies, with a length of up to 2 meters, ending with a fin on one side and the face on the other.
Apart from the fin on the backside they also have one on op of their body, allowing them to maneuver quickly underwater. 
At the bottom of their bodies they have extremities, that were once another pair of fins, but developed into something similar to arms and legs on land animals.
There are four of them, two in the front and two at the back. 
Unlike arms and legs, the front and back are the same, long strings of muscle.
They can be used to grab things, much like hands on land animals, although they don't have any fingers or similar ends, but end bluntly.
Each one is up to a meter long and can also be used to walk on the ground of whatever water an Ika is in.
The faces in front of the head consist of a mouth, containing baleens and eyes on each side, making them unable to see perfectly straight, but mostly to the sides, which is why Ika don't tend to swim straight forward but in curves.
Young Ika are born from eggs, which are buried and hatch without any parent over about 5 months.
They mature over another 5 months to a year, depending on how much food they have available and live up to 10 years afterwards.

### Iko

There is a subspecies of Ika, called Iko, which can survive inside and outside of water, but needing to breath oxygen.
They look like Ika, but have their bottom extremities developed into actual arms and legs, allowing them to stand and use as hands.
Those hands even have four fingers each, making them a lot more adapt to living outside of water. 
As a result of having legs they can walk on, Iko's bodies are more curved allowing them to stand more straight.
They still have two fins, one at the back and one at the top of their body, allowing them to still swim well, despite living out of water most of the time.


* live in the shallow sea water in the north west 
* sometimes swim very far out in the ocean, but prefer the more shallow waters, where they can walk the ground(water pressure)
* make contact with different races on the coasts/islands

* prefer to be around salt water
* settled around all the coasts of the continent, espceially around norht west islands
