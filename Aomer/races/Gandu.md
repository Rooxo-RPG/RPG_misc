# Gandu

## Physique

Gandu have a body with a similar shape of a crocodile.
They have the same body, except having longer legs they stand on, and two huge wings coming out their back.
A full-grown Gandu has a length of between 5 and 10 meters, with legs that are about 1.5 meters long.
The wingspan is even wider than their body, with up to 20 meters for the biggest ones. 
They are able to stand on their back legs, leaving their front legs free and possible attack with.
At the and of their legs, they have claws, which can rip apart most things that stand in their way.
Gandu are born from eggs, that are hatched over the course of 10 years, after which they take around 100 years to mature and live for multiple thousands of years.
Gandu are exclusively living off meat from smaller creatures, basically anything they can catch that's smaller than them. 
Because of that their stomachs can digest most things with relative ease and can survive ingesting most poisons.
