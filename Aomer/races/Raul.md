On both sides of the torso they have one arm, reaching almost all the way to the floor.
The hands of a Raul are big with sharp claws as fingers they can use to rip apart prey with little effort.
Their feet are like those of dogs, but bigger and stronger, allowing them to run at very high speeds when chasing prey and jump great distances. 
The whole body is covered in a few centimeter long fur, in grey, black, white and brown colors. 
Each Raul has a unique fur pattern, allowing them to distinguish one another.
They also have a tail, which is used for balancing their body.
It is just short enough so it doesn't touch the floor when walking or running.
Child Raul are born after a female is pregnant for half a year, and then need another 5 years to reach maturity.
After that they live something between 30 and 50 years.
