# Orein

## Physique
Orein are up to two meters long from tail to head, but only around 1.50m high from the ground. 
They weight 150-200kg and walk on four feet, which are similar to deer in looks.
Their torso is mostly the same as that of deer as well, but where the neck of a deer would start their torso transitions into a upper part that is very similar to a human torso, but which still has the same fur as the rest of the body, very short and a shade of brown.
At their back there is a small tail, only a few cm long and more light in color than the rest of the body.
On the side of the upper torso there are two arms coming out, which are similar in shape to human ones, like that part of the torso, but which also still have the same fur.
Their head also looks like that of a deer, round with a cone shape near the snout. 
They have long ears they can move in many directions and allow them to hear very well.
The males have horns on top of their heads which can be used to fight, although since they have arms they can use to hold actual weapons, those are rarely used for it anymore.
Instead, they are mostly used to impress other Orein, especially females.
Young Orein take 2-3 years to mature after a 1 year pregnancy, and live around 40 years.
They eat animals and plants they find in the woods, anything ranging from funghi to whatever animal is smaller than them.
Because of their diverse diet, their bodies can survive many things they ingest that are poisonous to them.

- living in forest with sentient trees
- can communicate with them (how?)
