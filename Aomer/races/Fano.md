# Fano

## Physique
An average Fano has a height of about 5 meters when standing on two feet, and around half that when walking on four feet, which they normally do. 
Most of their bodies is an ellipsoid shell, protecting their bodies.
These have five holes, where their arms, legs and head comes out of.
The holes are placed slightly in front of their bodies, so when in danger Fano can pull in their extremities and lying down, hiding inside the protective shell.
This way, predators can't attack them, as the shell is almost impenetrable and the holes can't be attacked, since they are on the ground.
The head of a Fano sits on a tube-shaped neck, that can be moved in all directions up until it hits the shell. 
It itself looks like an extension of the neck, being rounded off in the front, where the face sits.
In middle of the face, there are two small holes in the middle, the nose, and a cut below them, the mouth. 
It spans until the beginning of the neck, and in front the lower part sits slightly below the upper part, giving the Fano a way to cut off leaves they eat.
This is also their main defense other than the shell itself, where they can snap at a possible threat with a dangerous force coming from their cheek muscles.
Other than the hole, where the head comes out, the shell has four other holes for arms and legs and one small one for a small tail and a cloaka.
When walking on all fours, the arms and legs come out straight from the shell towards the floor.
When standing up, the legs are bent straight down and the arms are still going straight.
That way the Fano can use their arms to hold onto a tree and their legs to stand on the ground. 
Standing up isn't as stable as staying close to the ground, however, which is why they only stand up in order to grab leaves from trees, where there is something save to hold onto.
A Fano standing on its legs can be easily thrown over onto its back using the right amount of force, where they are helpless.
Arms and legs are both, like the neck, being able to move into all directions, only being limited by the shell itself, but hands and feet are mostly just a flat extension of the arm and leg tubes. 
So a Fano holding onto a tree has to entwine the tree using its arms and pushing its feet into the ground, eating from the leaves using its mouth.
Fano are born from eggs and grow to their full size over up to 50 years, which is around a fifth of the lifespan of an average Fano.
