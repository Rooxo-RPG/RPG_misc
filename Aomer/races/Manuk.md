# Manuk

## Physique 
Manuk are a birdlike people, growing up to 1.5 meters high when standing up. 
Their bodies are similar to those of humans, but covered completely in feathers.
For hands and feet they have talons with finve "fingers" each. 
Under their arms they have an extra set of feathers acting as wings, allowing them to fly.
A Manuk's head is almost as big es its torso, with a beak that is around 30 centimeters long and a 5 centimeter radius at the base.
Their feet are very short and only make up for a height of 30-50 centimeters, while their arms almost reach to the floor when standing up.
On the backside, they have a sort of tail made of feathers, which gives them more aerodynamics when flying.
Young Manuk hatch from eggs 3 months after being laid and grow their feathers within their first half year.
They start flying after another half year, at which point they are matured and live for up to 50 years.
The live off fruit and plant seeds, while some even eat meat from other animals, of which they need a lot more, because their bodies aren't adjusted to digesting it as well.
