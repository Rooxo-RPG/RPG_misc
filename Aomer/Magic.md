#Magic

* granted by a god to its most trusted followers
* can't be taken away
* gods determine the amount of power one mage can have
* but the mages own magical endurance can vary from the max power
* so they might not be able to use the full power they were granted until they train it 
* also they can only use a limited amount of power until their own reserves are used up
* then they need to refill their magic energy
