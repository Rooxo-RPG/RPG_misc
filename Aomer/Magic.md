# Magic

In order to become a magic user, one has to be a dedicated follower of one of the four gods. Once the god trusts a person enough, it might start a mental connection with the person, granting access to some of it's power. The stronger the bond is, the stronger the magical powers the mage will be able to use. On the other hand, a bond also benefits the god, allowing it to access the world through the senses of the mage. Once one of these bonds has been made it cannot be broken, only be strengthened by the god, making powerful magic users a very elite group among the population and polymages, having access to the power of multiple gods even rarer, as gods are very careful who to connect with.

Apart from the power limits a god puts on a mages, mages also have their own limits, having only a limited amount of stamina in spell casting. An apprentice mage can only sustain weak spells for short periods of time, regardless of the strength of his divine bond and has to train magic like a warrior has to train his strength. Once a mages stamina has been depleted, unlike a warrior's strength, it won't just refill after a period of rest. In order to regain their stamina, mages have to perform a ritual, which not only restores stamina, but temporarily lets them feel their own power on themselves. This can result in horrible pain for powerful mages, but will not leave permanent scarring, except possible mental ones. If a mages betrays his god, the god can also put this pain on them as a permanent curse, making them feel the pain all the time, without granting them stamina. And if those grey mages perform the repowering ritual, their pain will be magnitudes greater than the ones a normal mage would feel.

## Purple mages

The purple mages are the disciples of Omoi, god of gravity. He grants them the power to inflict gravitational pull on any objects they desire. Powerful purple mages can use these powers to make peoples bodies collapse under themselves or use it to throw boulders over great distances. Their repowering ritual returns this power onto them, making them feel the power they use in the world on themselves. Many purple mages will regularly feel like their bones are being crushed by an invisible weight and feel the pain of dying a hundred times over by being crushed to death, only to regain some magical power.

## Orange mages

The followers of Suhu are known as orange mages, once they get access to powers. They can freeze the lands or make them go up in flames with the flick of a finger. Even an orange apprentice has enough power to burn the skin off a person. But of course they will also pay the price. When they perform a repowering, they will at the same time feel their skin melting off their body while freezing to death, all multiple times during a single ritual.

## Brown mages

Zaas gives his followers the power to slow down and speed up time at their will. These brown mages have the power to stop time entirely or even speed it up so that weeks pass in a single minute. Powerful brown masters will just wait until their opponent in battle has withered away, while speeding up its time. The price they pay might be even higher than other mages, however. Brown mages will regularly see their loved ones, themselves or whole nations die, sometimes how it will happen in reality, sometimes only images, that never become reailty, all in a single repowering. Many brown mages go mad after a while, many others stop using their powers entirely, out of fear what they might see. 

## Green mages

Green mages, followers of Aine, have transmutational powers. Every green mage has unique powers, being able to turn different materials into each other, and possibly getting access to different material, if they please their goddess. As unpredictable as their powres are though, as unpredictable are their repowerings. Sometimes they might be lucky and only have their arms turn to wood. Sometimes they might be less lucky and have their skin into acid and burning through their body. Each repowering is a gamble, it's unpredictable how horrible it will be.


## Grey mages

The fifth type of mages, the grey ones, or polymages, are the rarest of all. These are the ones that have actually gained the trust of multiple gods at once, gaining access to multiple powers. The gods dislike these mages as much as they dislike each other, and they will notice if one is trying to become a polymage. And they also will curse them, making them feel the terrors of the repowering ritual every second for the rest of their lives. So only very few mages even want to become grey mages, and of those even fewer ever achieve that. These that do, often regret their choices, wanting to stop the pain they inflicted on themselves.
