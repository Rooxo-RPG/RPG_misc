# Balman

The island of Balman is surrrounded by vast oceans to each side.
It has a hot and arid climate and is mostly covered in savanna-like grassland.
Most of the time the weather is dry and hot, but every 15 to 20 days, there is 1-2 days of steady rainfall, during which the plants are revitalized and rivers and lakes are refilled.
After that rainfall during the next dry period most of that water evaporates again and many plants will be at the verge of death by the time the next rainfall comes.
This is why on this island most plants that survive require only little water or can save vast amounts of it.
The days between rainfall are very important to humans, and generally weeks are measured as the time between rainfalls.
Other than the constant switching from rain to dry periods, there is very little variation in climate, there are no seasons and temperatures are almost constant.
