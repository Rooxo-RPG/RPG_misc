## Ku-una

In the early days of human civilisation Zo-on and Ku-una were the same, but they differed in their interpretation of what fleshbending means.
Because of that, Zo-on hunted Ku-una in the belief they were acting evil, and Ku-una, being in the minority had to flee into the mountains to not get exterminated.
Ever since then the two cultures lived in mutual hatred of each other, Zo-on hating Ku-una because they use evil powers and Ku-una hating Zo-on because they were nearly killed by Zo-on.
Living in the mountains, Ku-una has little access to resources.
In order to fix that problem, they regularly raid Zo-on, killing many of them and taking their resources.
They also use this opportunity to get bodies to use to get power for fleshbending and even take the power of the ancestral flames and criminal flames when they take a village.
