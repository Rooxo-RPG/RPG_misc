# Story

## Backstory
The orphans Ara, a rogue, Gondolf, a warlord and Ugon, a paladin all came from the same village in the
Fey, where the two siblings Gondolf and Ara created an evil alliance with their friend Ugon,
called the S A D B O Y S, to lay terror upon the lands.
The Eladrin ranger Vethwirn, banned from his own village and the dwarfen mage Dhondan the Icebasher,
that needed to flee from his home for unknown reasons joined their cause of pure evil.
Together they want to create as much destruction in the lands of Aminor as they possibly can.

## The Beginning
One day, the S A D B O Y S find themselves in a tiny village in the North of the Greenlands.
Here they kill a villager to test for resistance and when there is none, they slay the whole village and burn
down the houses.
Alarmed by the flames, knights from the nearest city come to find out what happened.
The party wait for their opportunity and kill all but one of the knights that was going for help, after they
saw the slaughter that had happened in the village.
When more kinghts arrive, they flee into the woods.

## The Bandits
After they spend a night in the woods, where Ugon almost gets killed by a falling tree, but gets out after
Dhondan freezes the tree and Vethwirn falls off another tree, they find a bandit camp.
The S A D B O Y S want to convince the bandits to help them kill the soldiers at the village, but after
Dhonan fails a spell they have to kill the bandits in the camp.
Because both Dhondan and Ugon were heavily injured in the fight, they decide to wait in the camp and
hope to bring the other bandits that were not around during the fight on their side.
When those bandits arrive, the S A D B O Y S convince them that the soldiers were the ones that started
the fight and killed their companions.
When they scout the soldiers, they shoot their horses and injure on of them and run away. Presumably
the bandits will be blamed.

## The Mill
They then go further towards the West, where they find a mill. They murder the owner and his wife, loot
their home and leave blowing up the mill.
Then they leave back to the East and find a dungeon in the woods, where they find a magic orb, a scroll
and a magic stone.
They then procede to the city where the soldiers came from.

## Big City Life
When they reach the city they rob it with Darak and Lyannara, Pulp Fiction style and kill everyone inside,
leaving a signature ghost sound.
They then join forces with them and make plans for conquering the city.
On the next day, they identify the magic stone they found in the dungeon as a mind control stone owned
by a powerful wizard and Dhondan tries to identify it.
Lyannara and Ara scout the city, and find out about a hidden exit from the palace. Dhondan fails to
identify the stone's power and tries again.Dhondan fails a second time and the energy of the stone almost fades. In the evening they find the
hidden entrance to the palace.
When they enter the palace they get noticed by guards and have a fight off with the guards and maange
to kill them, take the patriarch hostage and leave a ghost sound saying "S A D B O Y S".
They even manage to crack his safe and steal his money. But when they return and Dhondan tries to
identify the stone again he breaks it.
The next day they interrogate the patriarch and exchange him for 6 horses and a pony, using those to
escape, but not after blowing up the stalls and leaving another ghost sound whispering their name.
While blowing up the stalls, Dhondan gets thrown off his horse, but Lyannara takes him on her pony and
they leave.

## current times(name for chapter not yet sure)
After looting a cave, they start their journey to the capital Kingsrend. Because Dhondan rides with
Lyannara, Darak gets jealous and crushes him in a staring contest.
On their way to the capital they go into another cave, kill a bear and when Dhondan tries to skin it, he
completely rips it apart.
When they reach the next bigger city, they enchant most of their items and decide to start something
here. It's not yet sure what it will be.
