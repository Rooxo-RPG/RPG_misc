# Notes
in the town people have problems with bandits lurking in the woods near the town.
They ask the party to get rid of them

They can find the bandits if they search for them in the woods, but the bandits might find them first
If the party reaches the bandit camp, they can find the bandits they previously "handed over" to the
kinghts

Since then the bandits escaped, but only 2 of the rest, one of them the mage.
They recruited other bandits and moved around, the mage bandit is their leader now.
