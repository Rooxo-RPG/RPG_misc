## PLANT1

PLANT1 is a small bush growing up to 30cm from the ground.
It has long, thin leaves, and small clumps of berries on its branches.
These berries are very small, round and blue, with a diameter of less than a centimeter.
They contain a very potent narcotic that is used in executions to take the pain of the fire and also in small doses as a recreational drug.
One berry is enough to induce a strong euphoric and relaxed feeling, two are enough to induce hallucinations and three are enough to induce a sort of coma. 
Any more than three berries can be deadly.

## PLANT2

PLANT2 is a plant growing in bushes around 1m high with small, round green leaves.
At the end of branches fist-sized buds are growing, that when ripe will explode, throwing the seeds away from the main bush leaving cotton-like pieces behind.
In the wild, these pieces are usually very small, but domesticated versions have a lot bigger of those pieces, which are used to create strings and fabric that are then made into bows and clothes.
The roots of these plants are very shallow in the ground, they are often washed away during rain season.
