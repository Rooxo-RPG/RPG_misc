# CULTURE1

The CULTURE1 people live in small tribes, without any central government. 
Tribes are in contact with each other, waging small wars or forging alliances with nearby other tribes.
Thus, neighboring tribes influence each other and their neighbors their own neighbors and so on, leading to some shared culture that gets more diluted the further you stray from a tribe.

# Religion

Most people of CULTURE1 believe in RELIGION1, which teaches that whenever a person is born some amount of "free evil", an invisible substance floating the earth is bound in that soul.
When that person dies, the evil will then evaporate from that body over the course of the next day, releasing the evil contained in the soul back into the world.
In order to stop that from happening the bodies of dead people are burned as fast as possible when a person dies, in the so-called ancestral flames, a huge fire that's contantly burning in each village.
When a body is burned in that timeframe, the people believe, the energy will not be released into the world, but contained within the flames.
The fact that flames turn a dark red, when such a body is burned is taken as evidence for this, as well as the fleshstones that appear after a lot of bodies are burned.
Removing evil from the world in this way serves two purposes: 
Firstly, only a person whose body has been purged by the flames, removing the evil contained will be able to move on to the afterlife.
Secondly, every time evil is absorbed by fire, it is removed from the world and, according to RELIGION1, once all the free evil is removed from the world, people can be perfectly good.
Once all the evil has been removed from the world, they believe, people will be perfectly good and no one will act evil, because all evil deeds come from some of the evil that's either interior to a person or an external force.
Such evil deeds, they believe, increase the evil within a person and increase the amount of free evil in the world, which is why crime is heavily punished.
For serious crimes a person will be sentenced to death by being burned alive, a process which is supposed to cleanse the soul as well as the body, allowing the person to be rid of the evil within them and allow them to go to the afterlife.
The way such a execution takes place is in a few steps.
At first, the sentenced will be sedated with PLANT1 in order to make the rest of the procedure less painful for them.
Then they will be placed in the middle of the town on a prepared stand, where they will be burned alive.
Here, the fact that the flames turn a darker red than if a person has died naturally is also taken as evidence there's more evil within that person.
Once the person has died, a wodden connection from the pyre to a different fire that's always burning, the criminal flames will be closed and the fire will be allowed to spread from the pyre to there.
Once the flames have joined the criminal flames and the pyre and the connection have burned down the ceremony is over and the remaining coals will be removed.
Both the criminal and ancestral flames are always kept burning in order to ensure the evil the flames supposedly contain won't return to the world.
After many bodies or criminals have been burned and the flames go out, forming a fleshstone, this new fleshstone will be taken by a priest and hidden far from the village out of fear CULTURE2 will find them on raids.

## Architecture

A very well liked material used to build houses is clay. 
Unfortunately there are very few places where clay can be found naturally, so there are few villages where clay finds heavy use in building.
In these places wood, stone and clay is used to build houses, in other places only wood and stone are used.
Normal houses are built using a round base of up do 4m diameter, surrounded by walls made from woven wood strengthened by clay or in rare cases, where wood alone isn't enough, even dirt.
Roofs, added on top of a base at 2-3m high are also made from woven wood, topped off with leaves to provide some shelter against rain.
The roof will either be the shape of a cone, where multiple long twigs are bound together at the top and other twigs are woven through those perpendicularly to create the roof, or it will just be a flat sheet of woven twigs.
Sometimes different kinds of houses are built, mostly for important religious leaders, or chiefs ruling over multiple tribes and villages. 
These houses take a very long time to be constructed and are rarely built in places where clay is not readily available.
They use little wood in the construction, but rely on clay and stone instead to build a house that not only stands out from the other ones by looking different but also by being a lot bigger in size.
These houses can easily have a base of 9-10 square meters and up to five meters high.
By the time such a construction is finished the person it was originally intended for often is either no longer in the same position they were when they demanded it, or not even still alive.
Because of that, these houses are rare and are often never finished and just stay around half finished sometimes used as a playground for children.
In a village houses are arranged in a roughly circular fashion, with the oldest ones near the center and newer ones more outside.
In the middle there is a big empty space where on one side the ancestral flames and on the other the criminal flames are placed and in the middle of which executions take place.
The older houses near the center are generally claimed by chiefs and spiritual leaders, unless they have their own bigger house, while the houses at the outskirts are often used by farmers and guards.

## Social Structure

Tasks in the community are distributed by family. 
Some families will be farmers, some others warriors, others priests and so on.
The position of an individual depends on their age, children are of the lowest standing, followed by elders and others unable to continue working, under the working members of society that are still below the priests which are only under the chiefs that sometimes also have to answer a different chief, depending on the political situation.
The chief also acts as head priest and is so not only political, but also spiritual leader of the village.
Since the path of a person is mostly determined by their family, the chief is also a heredetary office, only if the current chief dies without leaving an heir, they can choose anyone to succeed them, otherwise the oldest son or daughter of the chief will become next chief.
Chief and priest positions are also special in that they are the only positions that will not change social standing with age, a priest will always be top of the social ladder, even when they are very old.
This also means that priests and chiefs can't resign their office until death.
If someone wishes to change their job and possible their social standing with it, they can join a different family once they turn adult, provided the head of their own house, being the oldest working adult, and the head of the house they wish to join both agree with that decision.
At that point the person is no longer considered part of the family they left, but considered a normal member of the family they joined.
If someone doesn't want to stay in their family and also doesn't find a family to take them, or their head of house doesn't want to let them gone, young adults can also take the hard path and completely leave the village, hoping to join a different one or living in the wilderness on their own.

## Technology 

Tribes living near volcanoes have access to obsidian, which is considered the best available material for weapons and tools. 
The obsidian is either gathered at the foot of the volcano, where only little can be found or up in the mountains where gathering parties have to face off against CLUTURE2 people living in the mountains.
Other tribes have to either trade for obsidian with tribes that have access to it or use stones as a substitute.
Most use stone, since obsidian is relatively rare, and tribes that do trade with it often demand high prices only few can afford.
In terms of agriculture, the only domesticated plant is the PLANT2, which is planted around the outside of villages and from which a cotton-like substance is harvested, that is used to make fabric and strings.
There's also LIZARDS, used as hunting companions and pets in many tribes.
Other than that, CULTURE1 is mainly a hunter-gatherer society, getting their food and supplies from plants and animals.
Some berry plants and roots are able to be somewhat domesticated in some places, but understanding of these plants is very few and far between, making most experiments barely successful.

### Weapons

Warriors and hunters both use a spears, staffs, daggers and bows. 
The spears are just long poles of wood, that are either sharpened in the front or have a sharp piece of stone or obsidian attached at the front. 
Some people prefer purely wooden spears, because of how they fly in comparison to the other ones.
Other people prefer spears with additional tops attached, since those have an easier time puncturing armor and animal hide.
Staffs are very similar to spears, except they are not sharpened in the front and are used differently. 
They are mostly used as fighting weapons rather than hunting weapons and have a lot more complicated fighting styles than the other weapons.
For staffs there are also two different types, one with sharp stones or obsidian pieces attached at the ends and one without.
The type with ends are slower but more dangerous as they can leave more dangerous scarsm while the other type is faster but not as deadly.
For both types there are special fighting styles to bring out their full potential.
Daggers are made from only a piece of stone or obsidian and sometimes a wodden handle attached to it.
They are barely used for fighting, but as knifes, to skin and gut animals and similar tasks.
Warriors still usually keep a dagger on them for very close combat or if they ever need to cut something.
Bow and arrow are the last common type of weapon, they are very straightforward.
Using a piece of bendable wood and a string, bows are created, and sharpened sticks of wood are used as arrows.
Like with spears, arrows can either be made solely from wood or have an attached top made from stone or obsidian.
Again, arrows without attached tops have better aerodynamics while arrows with attached tops can puncture armor and skins more easily.
