## LIZARDS

LIZARDS are 1-2m long, 30-35cm high lizard-like animals, that are often used as pets in CULTURE1.
They behave very similar to dogs, in that they are very loyal to their masters and defend them at all costs.
They are often also very playful animals, but can nonetheless be very dangerous, with very sharp teeth and claws.
In nature, LIZARDS often have brown and yellow textured bodies, sometimes also green.
They have the natural ability to change their skin tones though, making them very good at sneaking up on prey and fun to play with, as they can be trained to change their colors on command.
Domesticated ones often have more variety in their skin coloring than wild ones.
Their tails can be thrown off when in danger, for example when it is being stepped on, and will slowly grow back, but LIZARDS that have thrown off their tail once will always look it.
LIZARDS in the wild live in small groups of up to 10, consisting of about one extended family.
They live up to 15 years in the wild, but up to 20 among humans, taking 2 years to mature, after which they can lay about 3-4 eggs every year, not all of which will necessarily even hatch.
Once adult, LIZARDS will either stay in their own tribe as the lowest ranking animal or leave the tribe to find a different one.
The social ranking is determinded by fights among members where the loser will become inferior to the winner.
