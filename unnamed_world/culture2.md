## CULTURE2

In the early days of human civilisation CULTURE1 and CULTURE2 were the same, but they differed in their interpretation of what fleshbending means.
Because of that, CULTURE1 hunted CULTURE2 in the belief they were acting evil, and CULTURE2, being in the minority had to flee into the mountains to not get exterminated.
Ever since then the two cultures lived in mutual hatred of each other, CULTURE1 hating CULTURE2 because they use evil powers and CULTURE2 hating CULTURE1 because they were nearly killed by CULTURE1.
Living in the mountains, CULTURE2 has little access to resources.
In order to fix that problem, they regularly raid CULTURE1, killing many of them and taking their resources.
They also use this opportunity to get bodies to use to get power for fleshbending and even take the power of the ancestral flames and criminal flames when they take a village.
