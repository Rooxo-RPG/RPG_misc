Every living body has an amount of energy that's inherent to it. 
When a person or an animal dies that energy is released over the course of the following day, after that it has vanished from the world.
Directly after dying a big part (~70%) of the energy is immediately released, the rest slowly vanishes over time.
The amount of energy and the type of energy varies by individual and species. 
Species that are closely related (e.g. wolves and dogs) have very similar energies while ones that are only distantly related or not at all will have very different energies.
These energies can be absorbed by other living things if their own energies are close enough to each other.
This can be done in one of two ways: Either a body has to be burned(dead or alive, alive will grant all of the energy, while dead will only grant what's left in the body)  and the flames will absorb the powers. 
When they do, they will turn red, indicating the power they now contain.
When someone enters those flames they can absorb the powers from the flames into their own body.
The other way is to use a so called fleshstone, a stone that is the materialized essence of these energies.
In order to use a flesh stone it has to be charged at first, which can only happen when it absorbs the energy from flames that have absobed it before. 
When a charged flesh stone is swallowed it will evaporate inside the body and the energy gets released.
Fleshstones are very rare, because they are created when a fire has absorbed very high amounts of energy.
It then collapses and leaves a small, red stone, a fleshstone.
These stones then can only store the energies that were used to create them, so a fleshstone that was created from a horde of wolves that have been burned can't be used to store energies from humans.
Similarly, if a fleshstone has been created from multiple different species, it will be able to store any of the energies that were used to create it, but any fleshstone will only be able to store as much energy as was needed to create it at most.
Once someone has absorbed some power, it will allow them to alter the shape of their body, under the laws of equivalent exchange.
The amount of energy inside a single living person would be roughly enough to grow an additional hand, but the matter this hand is made out of comes from the body of the fleshbender itself.
It is possible, with lifelong training and very high amounts of power to create matter when using the power, but it's so hard and wasteful that most fleshbenders will just gain weight and use the additional weight if they want to grow additional limbs.
