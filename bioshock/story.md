# Story

The PCs are asked by Ann Bernard to investigate the murder of her husband Vincent Bernard.
The wife only knows he works for Atlas.

If the ask Atlas he tells them he worked for him as a mole, spying on Ryan.
Vincent also managed the top secret library of Atlas. Only Vincent and two other people had access, Lawrence and Douglas.
Atlas has a suspicion that Ryan found out and had him assasinated.
He suggests they ask some of Ryan's men, what they know about Vincent.
Douglas is one of Ryan's assasins, it might have been him from what Vincent told Atlas
They have to be careful not to be identified as coming from Atlas, for example when they aren't working/under a false pretence etc.

Most of the people they ask tell them it was probably Ryan, as he is known for killing anybody that goes against him.

The bullet found inside Vincent's body is one of the guns known to be used by Ryans men as well.
If they can get Douglas' gun they can find the bullet was shot from his gun.

If they want to check the body they have to convince the owner of the morgue to let them in.
If they check the body, they can find one shot straight through the head, signaling a planned assasination.
If they check his pockets, they can find a letter reading as follows:

"Hello Vincent, 

meet me at 8 o' clock in the evening at the entrance of the smuggler's hideout.
I need to know your progress on Ryan

Gloria"

The time and place of the letter correspond to the death of Vincent.
Gloria turns out to be Gloria Rogers, who works for Atlas
(can be found out by asking Fontaine or someone else that could know about it)

Asking the right person will reveal she was in a bar near the hideout though, with some guy 
Asking Gloria herself will give defensive answers
there are some rumors she's cheating on her husband
No one knows who the man is, but he is described as tall, brown haired and with a scar on his left hand.

If they ask a henchman of Ryan about Vincent, they will tell them he was a very good strategist, that would probably have won the war for Ryan.
If they ask friends of Vincent about him they will tell them he has no idea of strategy, he can't even win a game of monopoly.

If they ask the right people (criminals, splicers that don't kill them , assasins) they will tell them the man with the scar is one of the best assasins in rapture, no one even knows his name
Atlas doesn't know the man with the scar. 
Gloria doesn't know either.

If they talk to Ryan, he will tell them that Vincent was one of his best strategists.
Only Ryan himself knows Vincent is actually a double agent for Ryan, but he won't ever tell.

There is another agent of Atlas in Ryan's ranks though, and he isn't a double agent, Scott Edward.
Atlas won't tell them about him, even if asked.
Not only Scott himself will tell them.

Lawrence and Douglas will tell them they didn't notice anything unusual.
Vincent checked the archives every day as always, although they are investigating missing documents.
They have no idea who could have been it, because only those 3 people could ever access the documents and they have been doing that for years.
These documents can be found at Ryans office or similar places leading to the conclusion Vincent was a double agent.

Scott also found this out, as he was sent by Atlas to control the other agents, so no one would switch sides.
The only one that knows about Scott are Atlas, Lawrence and Douglas.
They will only tell them that Atlas has more moles spying on Ryan and they have a system for keeping them in check
But the information they give out is only cryptic, they don't give details and only if pursued enough.

After the PCs have enough information to conclude that Atlas probably had Vincent killed, they will be ambushed and knocked out by some of Atlas' men.
They then wake up captured by Atlas, who is ready to tell them the whole story and ask them why they couldn't just blame Ryan.
Atlas found out that Vincent was a double agent for Ryan through his other agent Scott, and had him assasinated by the man with the scar.
He specifically wanted him to steal Douglas' gun to lay a wrong trace, as to not get blood on his fingers with  such an important person killed.
He was sure people would easily believe Ryan just killed him like he did with so many, Atlas is known as the hero of the revolutions and wouldn't even be suspected.
The only way he could have been found out is that somebody realised that Vincent was a double agent and that Atlas knew.
But only Atlas and Scott knew about it at all and Scott would never talk.
He then leaves them in his dungeon chained up and the PCs have to escape from the dungeon and then from rapture or find good place to hide from Atlas.

Once Atlas is gone they need to find a way out of the dungeon.
They can try all the classic ways like finding something to pick the lock or knock out the guard etc.
When they are free, they need to escape without being caught.
For that they need to either sneak around all the guards or knock them all out.
When they are out they can decide to notify Vincent's wife or just try to escape.

Possible methods of escape are:
-getting a bathysphere to leave rapture
-going to Ryan, telling him the story, hoping to be safe with him
-go undercover, try not getting found by Atlas and his men

they can also get caught by Atlas again, who then kills them(bad ending)

If they want to get a submarine, they first need to get a key to one.
Keys are hard to get as many people left rapture when the war started.
To escape they need to convince or steal one from someone that has one.
